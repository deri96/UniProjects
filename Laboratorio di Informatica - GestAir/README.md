<h1>LABORATORIO DI INFORMATICA</h1>
<p>
Laboratorio di Informatica (Programming Lab) is a subject where we learned to use a better programming method for create program. 
In this subject, we learned to use the dynamic allocations, pointers, files and so on. We used the C language to create a program 
that would solve certain problems in a specific area that has relevance to the real world.
