# UniProjects 
<p>
This repository was created to host and make public all the university projects created by me for the 
several exams carried out during the years of study at the University of Bari.
</p>
<p>
It consists of:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/deri96/UniProjects/tree/master/Laboratorio%20di%20Informatica%20-%20GestAir"> Laboratorio di informatica - GestAir </a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/deri96/UniProjects/tree/master/Progettazione%20e%20Produzione%20Multimediale%20-%20UnknownPlayer"> Progettazione e produzione multimediale - UnknownPlayer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/deri96/UniProjects/tree/master/Basi%20di%20Dati%20-%20WatArk"> Basi di dati - WatArk </a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/deri96/UniProjects/tree/master/Ingegneria%20del%20Software%20-%20Cicerone"> Ingegneria del Software - Cicerone </a></li>

</ul>
</p>
<p>
For each of them there is (or there will be, one day) a separate README from which you can read the main notions 
on the project and the related explanations of any steps not commented on.
