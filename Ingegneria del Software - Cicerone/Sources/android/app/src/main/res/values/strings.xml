        <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>If a user Cicerone deleted one of his tours that required a certain amount of money to partecipate,
        in which one or more Globetrotter had signed up for, all of the partecipants to that tour,
        after they have been notified, will be entitled for a complete refund of the sum payed.
        In the event that a Globetrotter wants to delete a reservation to a tour that he already paid for,
        the refund will not be done by the app. It will be on the Globetrotter in that case,
        to contact the Cicerone to obtain possible refund.
        <h2>Cancellazione account</h2>
        <p> - <strong>User Globetrotter:</strong>	    If a Globetrotter deletes his account, his data will
        be directly erased from the system and the app will not have any responsibility for possible
        activities to which the user has registered.</p>
        <p> - <strong>Utente Cicerone:</strong>	    If a Cicerone decides to delete his account, he must
        wait 30 days from the last paid activity he started to enable his data to be erased from
        the system. In the event that the account, at the time of cancellation,  has still paid activities
        in progress or in the event that 30 days since his last paid activity have not passed, the account can't be deleted.</p>
